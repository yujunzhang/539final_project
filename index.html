                <p>The panda, with its distinctive black and white coat, is adored by the world and considered a national treasure in China.</p>
    
                <p>Pandas also has a special significance in Chinese culture. According to Chinese tradition, the panda symbolizes peace, harmony, and friendship. It is also a symbol of good luck and positive energy. The panda is often depicted in Chinese art and literature as a gentle and noble creature, embodying the virtues of kindness, compassion, and wisdom.</p>

            <p>The biological diversity of the panda's habitat is unparalleled in the temperate world and rivals that of tropical ecosystems, making the giant panda an excellent example of an umbrella species conferring protection on many other species where pandas live. In other words, when we protect pandas, we invariably protect other animals that live around them, such as multicolored pheasants, the golden monkey, takin, and crested ibis. Pandas also bring sustainable economic benefits to many local communities through ecotourism.

                <p>Despite its popularity and iconic status, the giant panda is an endangered species. The main threats to the panda's survival are habitat loss, poaching, and climate change. Conservation efforts are underway to protect the panda and its natural habitat, but more needs to be done to ensure the long-term survival of this beloved species.</p>

                <p>The giant panda is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species. A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country. As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 different countries. Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild, while a 2006 study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000. Some reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise. In March 2015, conservation news site Mongabay stated that the wild giant panda population had increased by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864 individuals.
